Batch files and what they do:

- `new-post.bat` opens websites used to post on social media about a new Terrabyte post

**Note**: Workflows started within the batch file are meant for administrative purposes. However, others may find the repo useful for creating their own micro-optimization batch files.

## Setup

Current workspaces do not require any initial setup. However, future additions to these files may require a setup process.

**Note:** These configurations align with a general Windows setup. You may have to make adjustments depending on your OS and folder structure.
